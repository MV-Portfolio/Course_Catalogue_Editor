**Description:**
Project 1: Course Catalogue Editor (CCE)

The purpose of the CCE is to allow teachers to view all courses and to edit the courses they are in charge of in order to avoid the use of the old error prone system. They can update their courses to reflect what they need for the coming semester, things like the course description, course topics, Scheduling information, contact hours, and various other components can be edited. Admins can access the system and view the list of previous edits as well as view all courses like a teacher.
